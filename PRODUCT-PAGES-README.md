## Added Product Pages

We've updated the website with the following new product detail pages:

These new pages complement the existing product pages:

## Changes Made

1. Added routes in `App.tsx` for the new product pages
2. Updated the Products page to include all five products in the listing and comparison table
3. Fixed the links in the Home page to correctly navigate to the new product pages
4. Added validation scripts to ensure all routes and files are correctly configured

## Running the Project

To run the project with a clean cache:

```bash
./restart-product-routes.sh
```

To validate that all product routes and files are correctly configured:

```bash
./validate-product-routes.sh
```

## Product Page Structure

Each product detail page includes:

1. Hero section with product image and title
2. Key features section
3. Product image gallery
4. Technical specifications
5. Use cases
6. Call-to-action section
7. Related products section with links to other products

## Routing

The routing is set up in `App.tsx` and follows this pattern:

```jsx
<Route path="/urunler/payera-x10" element={<PayEraX10 />} />
<Route path="/urunler/payera-s20" element={<PayEraS20 />} />
<Route path="/urunler/payera-pro-30" element={<PayEraPro30 />} />
```

## Design System

All pages follow the company's design system with consistent:
- Color palette (primary, accent, background colors)
- Typography (headings, body text)
- Components (buttons, cards, sections)
- Spacing and layout
